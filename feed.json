            "content_html": "<p>I can't truly say that my husband is a romantic man, but he is occasionally afflicted by romantic impulses. One of those took place on a cold, dark January day when he told me he fancied the idea of making me a heart-shaped chair for Valentine's Day. I'm not the greatest romantic myself, but nor am I a fool who misses out on an opportunity when it's presented to her. I was delighted to agree to the plan.</p>\n<p><img class=\"  wp-image-350 alignleft\" src=\"https://aggoyder.github.io/ag-pages/media/posts/18/heart-chair-reject.jpg\" alt=\"heart chair reject\" width=\"163\" height=\"218\">The first thing we did was turn to the internet and search for heart-shaped chairs that might offer some design inspiration. As usual, it was astonishing how many  already existed, but how few really spoke to us. There were a lot of undeniably pretty chairs in the shield-backed style that felt just too ornate and old-fashioned for a modern setting. And then there were a handful of contemporary remakes that were daring and bold, but just too big a statement for what we wanted. <img class=\" size-full wp-image-351 alignright\" src=\"https://aggoyder.github.io/ag-pages/media/posts/18/heart-chair-too-new.jpg\" alt=\"heart chair too new\" width=\"225\" height=\"225\"></p>\n<p>Andrew likes to make contemporary furniture that's strong on teamwork, fitting in sweetly with pieces already existing in a room. We needed a chair that was easy, graceful, comfortable and accessible in design. Andrew's mother had a chair we'd long admired, an old-fashioned nursing chair with a low, generous seat and an elegant back. Andrew decided to allow his design to develop organically, taking these basic principles and sculpting a clean, modern form from them. He began with the base, creating a broad hoop base that sat low on simple cabriolet legs.<img class=\"  wp-image-349 alignleft\" src=\"https://aggoyder.github.io/ag-pages/media/posts/18/img_20170124_172156.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_20170124_172156\" width=\"226\" height=\"302\"></p>\n<p>Then he allowed the heart-shaped back to grow out of the tight waist of the chair, following contours that felt natural.</p>\n<p><img class=\"  wp-image-348 alignright\" src=\"https://aggoyder.github.io/ag-pages/media/posts/18/img_20170125_224151.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_20170125_224151\" width=\"227\" height=\"303\"></p>\n<p>Having got the basic form, we now needed to decide how it should be upholstered. Andrew wanted this chair to be as much about the upholstery as it was the shape. He was drawn to the idea of a plump, lushly cushioned chair, one that would echo the heart theme in spirit as well as in form. So it was back to the internet to search for possible fabrics.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-347\" src=\"https://aggoyder.github.io/ag-pages/media/posts/18/img_20170419_115839.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_20170419_115839\" width=\"647\" height=\"329\"></p>\n<p>Choosing a fabric is not an easy thing to do. Colours can vary so much between the internet image and the real material, so samples are a must. But even then, you have to bear in mind that a small square of fabric is going to look different when covering a large area. Patterns tend to calm down when spread over the whole expanse of a chair, but a plain fabric can look uncompromising and vast. I'd initially favoured a rose pink velvet for the chair, but when the samples arrived, I could see that I might end up with a great big marshmallow rather than the fun but sophisticated look we were after. But at the same time, Andrew wanted to risk a bit of bling and experiment with creating more striking effects. In the end we decided to try the invitingly-titled 'ritz flame' velour.</p>\n<p><img class=\"  wp-image-449 alignleft\" src=\"https://aggoyder.github.io/ag-pages/media/posts/18/009-c2979i.jpg\" alt=\"009-C2979i\" width=\"369\" height=\"554\"></p>\n<p>The finished chair makes me think of the Queen of Hearts in <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>. It has a little bit of fairy tale about it, but at the same time, the curved and angled back is extremely comfortable and the simple design won't overwhelm a room. It's perfect as a bedroom chair and could be an ideal chair for a young girl. It certainly appeals to my inner-twelve-year-old self! With a different fabric, you could create a very different effect: a pale blue or gold, or a dark burgundy, would make it a lovely addition to an elegant sitting room. All in all, it was a wonderful Valentine's Day present - though I'm warning Andrew that he's set the bar high now, and I'm not going to be satisfied with just a card after this....</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>I think it's pretty fair to say that Andrew is obsessed with chairs and chair design; it's what he most likes to make. But ask most people to think of a chair and they'll imagine one of a set that sits around a kitchen or dining room table. Or else maybe an armchair, fully upholstered and matching a sofa. It's rare that a single, individual chair, something interesting it its own right, will spring to mind.</p>\n<p>But everyone gets the rocking chair. Even though it's a quintessentially American piece of furniture that will stereotypically grace a verandah and contain a nosy neighbour watching the world go by, we can easily imagine ourselves using such a thing to sit in comfortably and read, chat, relax, nurse a child or soothe a worried mind.</p>\n<p>The rocking chair was probably invented in the early 18th century in America, but no one knows for sure. The earliest versions were ordinary chairs to which rockers (in one account I read, the blades of ice skates) were attached. The first designs were meant for more than one person: a mother and child, a patient and nurse, and some early American prints show rockers with cradles attached, so that a mother could rock her child to sleep and keep her hands free. They rapidly became popular in early 20th century asylums, thanks to the beneficial effect rocking had upon the troubled soul.</p>\n<p><img class=\" size-full wp-image-413 alignleft\" src=\"https://aggoyder.github.io/ag-pages/media/posts/19/sam-maloof-chair.jpg\" alt=\"sam maloof chair\" width=\"225\" height=\"225\"></p>\n<p>The best-known classic modern design belongs to Sam Maloof, who began designing and crafting furniture in the 1950s. He is celebrated for the fluid, sculptural quality of his chairs and the modern touch he brought to a rocker that was once a <img class=\" size-full wp-image-415 alignright\" src=\"https://aggoyder.github.io/ag-pages/media/posts/19/ron-arad-chair.jpg\" alt=\"ron arad chair\" width=\"225\" height=\"225\">bit ornate, upright and bulky. The rocking chair has appealed to a number of cutting edge designers including Ron Arad and Peter Opsvik, who in 1990 and 1999 respectively, created the single volume rocking chair from steel, and the 'gravity balance' chair that was supremely attentive to ergonomics, arguably at the cost of beauty.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-417\" src=\"https://aggoyder.github.io/ag-pages/media/posts/19/opsvik-rocking-chair.jpg\" alt=\"opsvik rocking chair\" width=\"202\" height=\"250\"></p>\n<p>When Andrew came to design his own rocking chair, he had a number of desirable attributes in mind. He wanted to combine the classic elegance of Sam Maloof with a more compact, curved shape; and he wanted to do this whilst being attentive to the ergonomic qualities of a good bespoke chair.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[gallery ids=\"425,426,427\" type=\"rectangular\"]</p>\n<p>The result was this beautiful chair (my personal favourite) with curved and shaped back splats, a neat overall shape and muscular front legs. There's an upholstered seat for added comfort. I couldn't help but notice that, from the front, its pear-shaped back and flat, rounded armrests gave it the air of a penguin. And so the <a href=\"https://goyderfurniture.wordpress.com/chairs/penguin-rocker/\">Penguin Rocker</a> it became.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-431\" src=\"https://aggoyder.github.io/ag-pages/media/posts/19/img_25031.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_2503\" width=\"1370\" height=\"2081\"></p>",
